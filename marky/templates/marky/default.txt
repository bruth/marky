## Marky.. A Live Markdown Editor

I use Markdown everywhere.. so I wanted a quick way to preview some Markdown before, say.. writing a blog post or writing a README for GitHub. Feel free to use it, it updates as you type.

In addition to the [lovely simplicity][1] of Markdown, here are extra **features** that have been added (look at the Markdown on the left):

### Tables of Contents

Automatically add `id="foo"` attributes to headers.

[TOC]

_Arguably there is a bug in the parser since I don't think it should render headers above the actual  `[TOC]` definition itself. In this example, the page title is included..._

### Autolinks

- www.google.com
- 192.168.0.1
- ftp://example.org
- jdoe@example.com

---

### Super/Subscripts

- 2^32^
- H~2~O

---

### Abbreviations

- HTML
- WWW

*[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language
*[WWW]: World Wide Web

### Footnotes

**Hello World!** examples are heavily overused.[^1]

[^1]: Although the [Hello World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program) is indeed overused, arguably every client-side MV* library known to man has a [Todos Example](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/) and has become the new _Hello World_.

### Fenced Code Blocks with Pygments

```coffeescript
hello (name) ->
    "Hello #{name}"
```

```javascript
function hello(name) {
    return 'Hello ' + name;
}
```
